## Abstract

We offer a new lens on an old question. Through the Recursive Symbolic Containment Proof (RSCP), we demonstrate that smooth solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations exist for all time, provided bounded initial energy. The proof is encoded in a symbolic recursion lattice with energy tracked by the Entropy Ledger Framework (ELF), and projected into classical PDE space via a structure-preserving map Φ. This framework asserts that contained recursive flow remains globally smooth.
